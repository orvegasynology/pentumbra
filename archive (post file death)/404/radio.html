The Russian subject still smells like urine, even after he was given a bath and deloused twice. And I think I might have killed the specimen from Mexico. His spleen is on the floor and hes not moving anymore. I can verify with certainty, however, that the barrier is not located in the spleen. Dr. Maxis -- no matter the cost. I wonder what he might think of the experiments on the little girl."

I still have not had any luck reprogramming any of the live specimens. Dr. Maxis --  key to unlocking the human mind will be more easily discovered on someone who isnt dead yet. I am not convinced. The army is stored until I can break this, this trust barrier. Oh, apparently someone in security found a spy on the move. Theyre delivering him from Verruckt, to replace the one that I broke."

They tried to send a rescue team into Verrückt that was aw-?-the first batch of test subjects. I suspect that there are others moles in the organization. Dr. Harvey Yena and Dr. Peter McCain, to be precise. Dr. Maxis any Americans in Group 935, no matter how much genius they hold. Stupid Americans with their apple pies and baseball and children, but I digress. The new American test subject is interesting and muscle-y. His intellect seems low, but his will is strong. Like the others, he doesnt seem to know who he is anymore. Unlike the others, he keeps breaking the restraints and yelling at me. Test subject N3WB is still staring at the floor, muttering what sounds like some kind of proverb over and over again. I think his mind may have been destroyed by the process. Oh well. The Russian subject recently begun responding to stimuli, but only after injecting him with a new serum made primarily from vodka. Perhaps this is a breakthrough in the-"

If he wont move those plans forward, then I wont continue following his dream of an undead army! He doesnt deserve his perch of power! He doesnt know what to do with it!
