      <h1>status updates. Nov 30th 2024</h1>
      <p>this one will be somewhat short. I am working on a microblog for these shorter blogs!</p>
      <p>a few minutes before i started writing this, i finally thought up a new theme for the homepage of pentumbra, and i like it! the initial idea for pentumbra was to be a site composed of entirely MY graphics and everything would belong to ME. however, the current homepage does not express that in the slightest, but dont get me wrong i LOVE the theme, but its not what i really wanted and i want to make it so much more about me, rather than just using things others have made, you know. <i>realistically i wont ever use just MY graphics, but you never know.</i></p>
      <p>ITS REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN!!!</p>
      <p>with the new theme sketched out, it will be more "expressive", "artistic" and "personal", as i will be drawing a shit ton of graphics for it this go round. I want people to see my art as soon as they walk into pentumbra!</p>
      <p>I have new shrine ideas! Stardew valley (which will also be a page for my character Per, to fufill my selfshipping dreams), and tomodachi life!</p>\
      <p>why am i worried about revamping existing pages? i need to get my gallery done, damn it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>as for myself, i am doing fine. still quite depressed, however. my phone broke after about 2 months of having it (it wasn't really that expensive, but it still irritated me in the moment), but in hindsight i believe it is good for me and it can keep me from staring at it all the time. id like to stare at the computer more.</p>
      <p>also? really pissed. i ordered a reigen figurine and theyre currently sending it back to sender because my address wasn't registered correctly, even though it was the SAME address that i had previously used with the company that held it. cool brah. got my money back, but i still want my fucking figurine and im scared to reorder it and it arrives while theyre trying to send another... too much.</p>
      <p>watched a lot of deathnote. currently on episode 18?</p>
      <p>i wanna learn how to crochet dolls and stuff</p>
      <p>that is all.</p>
