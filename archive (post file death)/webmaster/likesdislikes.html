        <p>Heres a fun story.</p>
        <p>Tennessee, mid pandemic, 2020. We were on our way to KC. Drive Thru Zoo.</p>
        <p>attempted to feed osterich pellets. Osterich steals my bucket and pours all of the pellets on its head.</p>
        <p>left bucketless the entire ride, and all of the critters gave me mean looks.</p>
        <p>trauma.</p>

        <summary>Having to remember if a German word for an animal is feminine or not</summary>
         
        <p>There is no particular rule set. You simply have to MEMORIZE whether or not an animal is masc or fem.</p>
        <p>
          der katze (neutral, masc) is improper to say.<br>
          die katze (feminine) is proper.
        </p>
        <p>
          die hund (fem) is improper. <br>
          der hund (masc) is proper.
        </p>
        <p>
          die kaninchen is improper. <br>
          der kaninchen is improper. <br>
          das kaninchen is proper.
        </p>
        <p>I mean, i get it if we all refer to animals masc or neutrally, like when we dont know the gender of an animal we just naturally refer to it as he, but this is ridiculous!</p>

        <summary>People who HATE cats</summary>
         <p>Suni of <a href="https://dokode.moe" target="blank_">dokode.moe</a> explained this best. (Not verbatim)</p>
        <q>I think when people hate cats it's more of a self reflection than anything else. I'm sure if you walked up to a random guy minding his business and grabbed him, you'd get slapped for it too.</q>
        <p>I mean, It's okay if you don't like cats. I'm not saying that you absolutely have to shower those little pricks with affection and bow every single time one even grazes your eyesight. But if you hate them, that's just how you feel about humans in general.</p>
        <p>cats are the animal most similar to us, believe it or not, cat haters!</p>

        <summary>ship discourse (and my views; dont look if you actually like me as a "person")</summary>
        <p>first off, shut up samantha. we dont care.</p>
         <p>im not against "proshipping", nor do i stand with those who harass and bully those on the internet for believing otherwise. if youre an anti that just straight up ignores proshippers, good for you.</p>
         <p>i stand on the side who is anti-harassment and pro free speech. id love to say that i am on neither side, but i genuinely dont care regardless. (draw the line at age-gaps especially adult-minor gaps please. or like, dont share it at least.)</p>
         <p>i consume what i like. if these taboo ships are not sexualized or encouraged in any form and are actually written/done correctly, i will happily endorse the product. otherwise they can screw off.</p>
         <p>Im an avid believer of "dont like dont interact". just do that. antis, dont waste your time arguing or crying over a proshipper. block and move on. proshippers, stop drawing two men who are of the same age canonically with one of those dudes as a kid, making out. or at least dont let the internet know youre into that stuff. i wouldnt want to be friends with you if i knew. weirdo.</p>
         <p>i am open for discussion on this one... shift my view. and proships, dont bring kids into it. also if ur a kid and do that stuff ewew ew ew stop</p>
