                </p>
                <p>short answer: Reigen Arataka is a deuteragonist for the anime Mob Psycho 100. He was also chosen as
                  a candidate for the Tumblr sexyman poll, and lost miserably to Sans (Undertale), which is why Queen
                  Elizabeth died. (partially true / for anyone wondering, i chose Sans and i hate myself too)</p>
                <p>He's just a conman with a heart of gold and I truly do adore him for it. He's a lil guy. An asshole.
                  Pathetic. Only 1/3rd idiot.</p>

                  <p>I don't, why would anyone ever tell you that lie? I really, really don't</p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>...Let's start off from season one, when i thought he was just really dumb. After he called mob to go kill that roach ghost or whatever i was like "wow this guy is pathetic". And then the way he spoke to mob, when mob literally makes his money. like wtf bro. I really didn't like him.</p>
                  <p>remember that episode (i think 2, ive watched this anime 4 times but cant tell you what happens in each episode off the top of my head) when he fuckin... gave that guy a massage or whatever and then reigen was like</p>
                  
                  <div class=""><img style="width:220px" src="/data/assets/reigen/sexcthang.gif"></div>
                  
                  <p>i think that made me dislike him a little less. like "wow this guy is a douche but hes lowkey hot" a little less.</p>
                  <p>i stopped hating him when he stopped mob from going psycho (pun intended) and decided he was okay. because he really does care about shigeo. especially earlier in the arc when he actually went out to the place just for mob. its okay to run away.</p>
                  <p>idr much from S2 because for whyever reason hulu decided to put season 2 3 months after they put season 1 and 3 on there so idk. i think that was the mogami world arc. reigen wasn't too important.</p>
                  <p> and then he pissed mob off. oh god</p>
                  <p>reigen really shouldve shut his mouth. i really like the message he was trying to convey (choose your friends wisely), but not only did he make it about himself (YOU BELONG TO ME!!!) but he didn't know mobs friends, so he was 100% in the wrong. i straight up thought he was pathetic and it was sad he relied on a kid for his business. and then he really just didn't cope right until he was puking lemonade (pathetic) in an alleyway and he was like "yo ive been taking this little kid for granted. i gotta get it together".</p>
                  <p>he continued his business without mob for a while. cool. he did a lot better than he initially did with him. also cool. not a bad thing. good for him. he bettered himself. slayed, too. i mean hes still a lying conman but thats a start. i actually began to like him. he and his arc in that season. cool. cool.</p>
                  <p>REIGEN EXPOSED!! that was funny asf watching the first time. and mob was like rip lmao</p>
                  <p>then he did a little dance at that conference. mob shook things up because he also believes that reigen is pathetic. people left confused. this sounds like something straight off of the cookie clicker ticker.</p>
                  <p>then mob fought suzuki? and reigen wwas like "yo i gotta go save my baby or whatever even if it costs me my life" power of friendship type shit.</p>
                  <p>Season 3... lets go... moe aliens, giant broccoli, and then that entire monologue to Mob when he was about to shit his britches and that delibrately glued peice of cloth attached to his weiner. thats when i was like. this guy is good. okay. he owned up for his lies.</p>
                  <p>but its the fact he got away with his lying that baffles me. also mob destroyed the entire city...? broski that car did NOT hurt.</p>
                  <p>i never really got into why i like him. After watching the anime again, I shifted my interest towards Reigen. After getting to know him thoroughly, He's honest, mostly. He's genuinely trying to be a nice person. He's the most interesting, goofy, and absolutely "most human" anime character i've ever seen. His growth is uncanny, he had an excellent intro, and outro. He's so unique. And thats why I admire him. He's the person I want to be one day, charismatic, honest. and a little pathetic. He's my <span title="first being harvey from stardew valley.">second</span> malewife. boypussy. fuck yeah.</p>
                  <p>Also ONE has privilege. OPM goes so hard lol</p>
